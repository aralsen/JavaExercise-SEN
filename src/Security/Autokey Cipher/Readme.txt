My code was tested on remote.cs.binghamton.edu. (openjdk version "18.0.2" 2022-07-19)

How to execute:

make -> will create a Auto.class file
java Auto in out 1 -> will create 'out' file which include  encrypted text
java Auto out in1 0 -> will create 'in1' file which include decrypted text

After executing the above commands, the file content in files “in” and “in1” are the same.
